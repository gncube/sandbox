# Crayons: A Collaborative Framework for Architects

## Overview

Crayons is a lightweight collaboration framework designed specifically for architects to sketch, share, and evolve architectural designs together. Like the versatile drawing tools we all know, Crayons provides simple yet powerful ways to express complex architectural ideas.

## Principles

### Color Outside the Lines

- Challenge conventional thinking
- Experiment with unusual approaches
- Value creative solutions over rigid adherence to standards

### Share Your Box

- Make your work visible early and often
- Provide access to works-in-progress
- Maintain transparency in decision-making

### Mix Colors Freely

- Combine different architectural styles and patterns
- Integrate ideas from various team members
- Create new solutions through thoughtful hybridization

## Collaboration Workflow

1. **Sketch** - Create initial architectural drafts using simple diagrams
2. **Share** - Push your ideas to the shared repository for visibility
3. **Discuss** - Provide and receive constructive feedback
4. **Refine** - Iterate based on collective insights
5. **Document** - Capture the evolution of ideas and decisions

## Tools & Practices

### Daily Palette

Brief daily stand-ups to share what each architect is working on, using visual aids whenever possible.

A shared repository where all architectural diagrams, decisions, and evolution are documented.
